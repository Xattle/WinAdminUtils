FileAudit Tool
By Nathan Griswold

A python/ps1 utility for auditing permissions on file structures, recursively.

GenerateFileAudit.ps1 generates the csv and is best when ran directly on the target filesystem.
	It's generated by AuditFileSystem during runtime and then removed. It can also be generated with the -g flag.

AuditFileSystem.py handles this potentially huge csv and formats it in a number of ways.
AuditFileSystem.py takes -h or --help flags for more details
